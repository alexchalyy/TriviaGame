# TriviaGame

# Game description

 When user clicks start, he is navigated to quiz page, and he has 100 seconds to answer all questions. If the user clicks done, or runs out of time, the answer scores are displayed on the next page (correctly, incorrectly, and unanswered question numbers).

# Game creation process

Three static html webpages were created for different stages of the game. They were styled using css, bootstrap, and media queries to be mobile responsive. The game logic code is written in javascript using jQueries. Local storage was used to store game scores and transfer them from quiz to results when javacript was terminated and reloaded when quiz page was closed and results page was opened.
